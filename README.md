# Assignment: OpenLayers Intro
## Worth: 20 points (extra credit)
## Due: Wednesday, May 1, 11:59pm

## Background
OpenLayers is a javascript library that allows any web page to display a dynamic map. It can display map tiles, vector data and markers loaded from any source. OpenLayers has been developed to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. It is completely free, Open Source JavaScript, released under the 2-clause BSD License (also known as the FreeBSD) (From https://openlayers.org/).

The architecture of an OpenLayers web page relies on an understanding of the basic components of OpenLayers: `Map`, `View`, `Source`, and `Layer`. The OpenLayers docs describes these components:

## Assignment
Pick three of the examples listed in the OpenLayers [Examples](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/index.html). For the assignment, turn in screenshots of your running example showing the Address bar and name them after the example you chose (e.g., `draw-features.png` or `heatmap-earthquakes.png`). Submit the files in a new branch named `openlayers`.
